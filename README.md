Today i will be exposing this horrid paste..


Hi, i love to leak sources, expose french scammers, be rich. On my github i will be leaking lots of good shit, ud ofc, and helping people. dm me on discord @Thermal#5000 if you need help. 


Our first expose is on a new p2c knows as "Sinure" (https://discord.gg/GMembqh646)

These clowns are selling a cheat that is suppose ud eac and be but if you look at vouches, noone is in a tourney or over 4k points. 

The source the are using is Dimensions leak (@proaids) leaked this source in the first place fully skidded cheat off vase anyway,

The owner (Beifz) was on a call with me started screensharing then ss src named "dimensions" then realised, ended stream then rename to "beifz.me" 

We can see here that he has fixed up the source ready for sale due to when being launched you get 48 errors needing atleast half a brain to fix.
